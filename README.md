# ArduinoPractice
A place where I can put my beginner programs for practicing with an Arduino UNO. I am following the book "Make: Getting Started with Arduino 3rd edition"

So far I have the following programs: 
1. BlinkingLED (makes a certain light on the Ardunio Uno turn on and off in 2 second intervals)
3. ButtonLED (makes an LED light turn on when a button is pressed)
