# ArduinoPractice
A place where I can put my beginner programs for practicing with an Arduino UNO. I am following "Arduino Projects Book"

So far I have the following programs: 
1. BlinkingLED (makes a certain light on the Ardunio Uno turn on and off in 2 second intervals)
2. ButtonLED (makes an LED light turn on when a button is pressed and leaves the LED light on for 10 seconds)
3. Spaceship Interface (a green LED light is always lit up but when a button is pressed, 2 red LED lights turn on and off)
