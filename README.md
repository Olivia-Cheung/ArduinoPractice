# ArduinoPractice
A place where I can put my beginner programs for practicing with an Arduino UNO. I am following "Arduino Projects Book" to help understand circuits, hardware, and programming for Arduino UNO.

So far I have the following programs: 
1. BlinkingLED (makes a certain light on the Arduino Uno turn on and off in 2 second intervals)
2. ButtonLED (makes an LED light turn on when a button is pressed and leaves the LED light on for 10 seconds)
3. Spaceship Interface (a green LED light is always lit up but when a button is pressed, 2 red LED lights turn on and off)
4. Love-O-Meter (a temperature sensor measures the heat of someone's finger and the red LED lights turn on or off depending       the temperture measured)
5. ColorChangingLamp* (an RGB LED light changes color based on which phototransistor is covered)
6. MoodCue (using a servo and a knob in a potentiometer, the servo can move and point to the mood that the user is in)
7. LightTheremin (uses a phototransistor that measures the light and based on how much light it picks up, the piezo will make     sound)
8. KeyboardInstrument (piezo plays notes C, D, E, and F based on which programmed button is pressed) 
9. DigitalHourglass (modified to 6 seconds, led lights light up one by one every second that passes and starts over when the tilt sensor detects movement)
10. Pinwheel (a motor spins when a button is pressed)
